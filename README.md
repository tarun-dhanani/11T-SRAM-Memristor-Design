# 11T-SRAM Memristor Design

This project is part of my final year B.Tech work focused on designing an 11-transistor SRAM cell using memristors.

## 📌 Features
- 2-Memristor and 4-Memristor configurations
- Simulation using LTspice
- Compared power, delay, and area

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- LTspice

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `/schematics`: Circuit diagrams
- `/results`: Simulation waveforms & data

## 👤 About Me
I’m passionate about embedded systems, circuit design, and next-gen memory technologies.
